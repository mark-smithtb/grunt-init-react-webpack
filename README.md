# grunt-init-react

grunt-init template for a very basic react project based on skratchdot's https://github.com/skratchdot/grunt-init-react.

## Getting started

### Installation

If you haven't already done so, install
[Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) and
[grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init):

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli grunt-init
```

Once [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) is installed, place
this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you
use `git clone` to install this template into that directory as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mark-smithtb/grunt-init-react-webpack.git ~/.grunt-init/react
```

### Usage

Now that `grunt init` is installed. At the command-line, cd into an empty
directory and run `grunt-init react` and follow the prompts. You might want to
test that it works before you begin customizing the project:

* Next, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
* Then, run `npm run watch` to build the project and test that it works.

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be
sure to change to a new directory first._
